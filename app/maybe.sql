More than a company, or clothes, the trio wanted to create a lifestyle. Starting in the summer of 2009 they dove head first into the world of design and production. After six months and a huge learning curve, Holstee launched it's first line of Recycled Tees made of 100% recycled plastic bottles that were milled, cut and sewn within 150 miles of each other in North Carolina. Starting with this first round, 10% of all sales were lent to entrepreneurs in extreme poverty through non-profit micro-lending organizations like Kiva.org - a tradition they are proud to still embrace.
A few months later, Mike needed a new wallet and wasn't finding the sort of functional and minimal design he was looking for so they decided to create their own. A few quick mock-ups and the idea of a Holstee Wallet came to life. Teaming up with an NGO in India that had perfected a method of using plastic bags collected off the streets of Delhi to create a unique 100% upcycled textile, they had prototypes in their hands a few weeks later of their new dream wallet. They made just enough for themselves and a few friends, each of whom instantly loved them. From there they decided to make a few more and sell them on Holstee.com along with their tees. Now the wallet is now one of our best selling products.
In the summer of 2010, Holstee launched a new area of their site, Curated x Holstee, following the mantra “Curating with a Conscience.” This is where the Holstee team seeks out some of the most beautiful and innovative sustainable designs and shares them with their community through their video reviews, newsletter, and shop.','http://www.holstee.com/','9','products','Lifestyle design with a conscience.','2009','','','','','','','2012-05-13 05:09:04.395453','2012-05-13 05:09:04.395453');

“At the heart of Macrosense are powerful machine learning algorithms that process time-stamped location data and metadata streams from heterogeneous sources - GPS, WiFi positioning, cell tower triangulation, RFID and other sensors â€“ allowing companies and investors to better understand and predict human behavior on a macro scale.”

“Macrosense transforms raw location data into intelligent data streams that drive a variety of applications and visual representations.

Bridging the gap between dated retail systems and advanced cloud technology, ShopKeep® provides mass customization and alternative to common payment platforms.

ShopKeep® replaces traditional expensive point of sale terminals with an easy to use, high-end technology that stores all data in the cloud.  Because of the low up-front cost (under $1,000 for all hardware including an iPad), ShopKeep® is also a financially viable alternative to a basic cash register.

ShopKeep® is comprised of two parts: (1) front-end cash register interface for iPad or Mac; and (2) a ‘BackOffice’ website where all transaction data is located and available for store owners and managers to view from any web browser.  The register front-end is synced with the BackOffice, which provides full reports and QuickBooks integration for real-time accurate reports with the click of a button.

They took that idea and ran with it, and in 2009, launched their first Urban Games, as the most interactive way to experience the Big Apple, all from the convenience of your own cell phone.

Since then, we have brought our urban games from sea to shining sea, launching in over a dozen cities in the US with the help of some local friends. Then we jumped over the pond and gave Stray Boots to all the jealous Brits who had played here in the USA, launching UK: The Game in November, 2011.

Over this time, we have ve taken pride in keeping things fun and keeping them simple. To that end, we are fully committed to two things: Showing you an amazing time around the city of your choice and providing exemplary customer service along the way.  Simply put, we love what we do, and love making sure you do too. It seems others have taken notice, as our Games have been featured in the The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Fast Company, and have been profiled multiple times on TV by Fox and ABC.

Having assembled a crack team of nerds, we're setting out to conquer the world. Our plans include expanding across the globe and offering an ever-richer experience to our happy customers.

So, please, go ahead and try one of our games. We're sure you'll have a blast, and that you'll learn a thing or two about your city along the way.

The reviews on Unigo are included in US News & World Report’s college directory and rankings. Founded in 2008, Unigo is based in New York and funded by McGraw Hill and angel investors.  

Unigo offers the ability for prospective students to have a live one-on-one video session with college counselors and current college students from around the country. With more than 15,000 college students and counselors available for sessions, prospective students can browse and search based on the type of desired session, areas of interest, region, ethnicity, and much more. Customers can purchase and begin a live chat instantly, or choose a more convenient time based on the student or counselor’s availability schedule. The counselors and college students available for live sessions have all been personally vetted by the Unigo team to ensure a valuable and informative experience for prospective students.

Research by Public Agenda, commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, suggests the existing high school guidance system is a perilously weak part of the nation’s efforts to increase college attendance. The report offers disturbing confirmation that the system is failing. The College Board estimates the national ratio of high school students to college counselors is 467 to 1, and college counselors only spend an average of 38 minutes per student per year, according to a report commissioned by the National Association for College Admission Counseling.  

Frustrated by his own experience with the college admissions process, as an 18-year-old college freshman, founder and CEO, Jordan Goldman began his career by creating the “Students’ Guide to Colleges” series of college guidebooks, which were released in five annual editions from Penguin Books. Eight years later, he raised angel financing to start Unigo. The son of a veteran public school teacher, Unigo’s mission is to make higher education more accessible to the 25 million students and their families who research the college admissions process each year.','http://www.unigo.com','16','ecommerce','Online College Resource','2008','','$1.6M','http://www.crunchbase.com/company/unigo','college, student, high-school, platform, user-generated-content, resource, publisher','Unigo','http://www.unigo.com/expertnetwork','2012-05-13 05:09:04.395453','2012-05-13 05:09:04.395453');
