After six months and a huge learning curve, Holstee launched it\'s first line of Recycled Tees made of 100% recycled plastic bottles that were milled, cut and sewn within 150 miles of each other in North Carolina. Starting with this first round, 10% of all sales were lent to entrepreneurs in extreme poverty through non-profit micro-lending organizations like Kiva.org - a tradition they are proud to still embrace.\nA few months later, Mike needed a new wallet and wasn\'t finding the sort of functional and minimal design he was looking for so they decided to create their own. A few quick mock-ups and the idea of a Holstee Wallet came to life. Teaming up with an NGO in India that had perfected a method of using plastic bags collected off the streets of Delhi to create a unique 100% upcycled textile, they had prototypes in their hands a few weeks later of their new dream wallet. They made just enough for themselves and a few friends, each of whom instantly loved them. From there they decided to make a few more and sell them on Holstee.com along with their tees. Now the wallet is now one of our best selling products.\nIn the summer of 2010, Holstee launched a new area of their site, Curated x Holstee, following the mantra “Curating with a Conscience.” This is where the Holstee team seeks out some of the most beautiful and innovative sustainable designs and shares them with their community through their video reviews, newsletter, and shop.','http://www.holstee.com/',9,'products','Lifestyle design with a conscience.',2009,0,'','','','',''),(120,1,'http://www.hotlist.com/careers/','FALSE','Hotlist','Hotlist is a location-based social media platform that helps friends coordinate plans and discover what’s going on today, tomorrow, and throughout the week at millions of venues worldwide.\n\nBy following Friends, Places, and Brands, users receive personalized notifications and suggestions that cater to their specific social interests.\n\nWith Hotlist’s Planner, users can quickly and easily determine the most convenient time and place for Facebook friends to meet up via their smartphone or the web.\n\nUsers can take “virtual peeks” inside of places and see Facebook profile photos of the expected crowd, girl/guy ratio, and which of their friends plan to be there (even if they’re not on Hotlist).\n\nHotlist uses over 110 million people’s plans to provide social information on over 3 million venues in more than 40,000 cities.
