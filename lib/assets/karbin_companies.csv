After six months and a huge learning curve, Holstee launched it\'s first line of Recycled Tees made of 100% recycled plastic bottles that were milled, cut and sewn within 150 miles of each other in North Carolina. Starting with this first round, 10% of all sales were lent to entrepreneurs in extreme poverty through non-profit micro-lending organizations like Kiva.org - a tradition they are proud to still embrace.\nA few months later, Mike needed a new wallet and wasn\'t finding the sort of functional and minimal design he was looking for so they decided to create their own. A few quick mock-ups and the idea of a Holstee Wallet came to life. Teaming up with an NGO in India that had perfected a method of using plastic bags collected off the streets of Delhi to create a unique 100% upcycled textile, they had prototypes in their hands a few weeks later of their new dream wallet. They made just enough for themselves and a few friends, each of whom instantly loved them. From there they decided to make a few more and sell them on Holstee.com along with their tees. Now the wallet is now one of our best selling products.\nIn the summer of 2010, Holstee launched a new area of their site, Curated x Holstee, following the mantra “Curating with a Conscience.” This is where the Holstee team seeks out some of the most beautiful and innovative sustainable designs and shares them with their community through their video reviews, newsletter, and shop.','http://www.holstee.com/',9,'products','Lifestyle design with a conscience.',2009,0,'','','','',''
