As new versions of Phantom are released\nand vetted, this module will be updated accordingly.\n\nNOTE: Currently this has only been set up to fetch and run Phantom for MacOS\n(darwin) and Linux based platforms (as identified by nodejs).  If you want\nwindows support, feel free to send a patch.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\n```shell\nbin/phantom [phantom arguments]\n```\n\nAnd npm will install a link to the binary in `node_modules/.bin` as\nit is wont to do.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nQuestions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.\nSubmit them at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/phantom/).\n\nBug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the\nbest. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n[Dan Pupius](https://github.com/dpup)\n([personal website](http://pupius.co.uk)), supported by\n[The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2012 [The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. \nSee the top-level file `LICENSE.txt` and\n(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n",
